        "# The Pigeonhole Principle\n",
        "If we suppose that a flock of 10 pigeons flies into a set of 9 pigeonholes to roost, there are 10 pigeons but only 9 pigeonholes, a least one of these 9 pigeonholes must have at least two pigeons in it. If each pigeonhole had at most one pigeon in it, at most 9 pigeons, one per hole, could be accommodated. This shows a general principle called the pigeonhole principle, which states that if there are more pigeons than pigeonholes, then there must be at least one pigeonhole with at least two pigeons in it.\n",
